\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

As mentioned earlier, we are looking to create our own classifiers with an off-the-shelf open-source deep learning library for speech recognition. We intend to do this for each CAPTCHA system by training with datasets collected from all our previous experimental runs and evaluations. Our focus is mainly towards Securimage and Microsoft Live since we have low accuracy rates for both of them.\newline

We also intend to look into 2 other CAPTCHA systems - Mollom and SolveMedia both of which are being used by some popular websites.\newline

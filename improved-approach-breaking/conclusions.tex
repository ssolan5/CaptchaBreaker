\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we demonstrated a novel, low-cost approach to break audio CAPTCHAs. We did this using the off-the-shelf speech recognition APIs and libraries. We also demonstrated how using simple audio processing techniques using an open-source tool like Audacity helps in improving accuracy.\newline

We evaluated the eight audio CAPTCHA systems against the five different solvers that we used and presented the results along with accuracy and the time taken to solve the challenges. We saw how our system faired poorly against Securimage and we also discussed how we could improve our system in the future to increase our attack against that service.

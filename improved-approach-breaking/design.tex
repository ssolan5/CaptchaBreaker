\section{System Overview}
\label{sec:design}
Our system consists of a Python web crawler that loads the required page, finds the audio element in the page and downloads the challenge. It then converts the audio file into the required audio format and hands it over to Audacity that applies the appropriate Action Chain for the CAPTCHA system. The action chain or audio processing chain used for each CAPTCHA service will be explained in further detail in Section 5. The connection between Audacity and our crawler is established through open-source libraries like \textit{ldtp} or \textit{pywinauto}. \newline

Once Audacity completes the audio processing, control is transferred back to our system that connects to the speech recognition web services. When a list of alternative transcriptions is returned, our script selects the most appropriate one among them. It then enters the response into the response box using Selenium, and the challenge is submitted. Once it is submitted, an element on the page is generated which tells the user if the submitted response was correct or not. We look for this element on the page and gather this result. We next store these results in a CSV file along with the file name and the time it took to solve each challenge. \newline

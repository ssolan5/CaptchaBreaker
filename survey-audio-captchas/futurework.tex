Our system relies on off the shelf tools that did not respond to reduction of noise using simplistic techniques such as applying sox commands to remove certain frequencies. Noise removal is necessary for improving accuracy for Securimage, BotDetect and all other services. Our future work will focus on generating noise profile for Securimage using tools like MATLAB or Audacity to filter out noise and using a deep learning system.\newline

Our work shows that in an effort to improve the CAPTCHAs for human understanding they have become vulnerable to off the shelf ASRs. Further research is required to improve the functionality of CAPTCHA's as their intended use to prevent automated solvers such as ours gaining access to content.

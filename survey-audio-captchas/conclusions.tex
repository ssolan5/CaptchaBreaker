\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we demonstrated a novel, low-cost approach to break audio CAPTCHAs. We did this using the off-the-shelf speech recognition APIs and did not train our system using AI and Machine Learning. We evaluated the various CAPTCHA providers against the various solvers that we used and presented the results along with accuracy and the time taken to solve the challenges. We also discussed how we could improve our system in the future to increase our attack against the services we evaluated.

\note{First paragraph sets the context.}
According to the World Health Organization 285 million people have some form of visual impairment~\cite{impaired}.

Previous work has found that popular audio captchas are more difficult than their visual counterparts,
which was also corroborated by a subsequent systematic evaluation of users' ability to solve various types of
captchas~\cite{captchas-are-hard}.

\note{Second paragraph is more specific. Talk about audio captchas, give some relevant statistics.}

\note{Third paragraph is about what has been done before, what has changed and what is missing.}

\note{Fourth paragraph talks about what we have done, describes our system.}

\note{Fifth paragraph gives some of our important results.}

Overall, the main contributions of our work are:

How can we fix this problem? The amount of noise we can add before an audio captcha becomes unusable is 
far more constrained than for visual challenges.

Captchas present an interesting dilemma from a design standpoint, as they are an exemplary instance
of usability and security being at direct contradiction. Adding more noise (or distortion) to combat
automated solvers will also have a significant negative effect on the ability of users to actually
solve challenges.

Human hearing is more error prone than vision~\cite{o2009auditory,shinn2008object}.

Previous work has found that popular audio captchas are more difficult than their visual counterparts,
which was also corroborated by a subsequent systematic evaluation of users' ability to solve various types of
captchas~\cite{captchas-are-hard}.
